Front-End Coding Challenge
===

### Premise
It’s not always easy to evaluate a candidates technical abilities. While we love writing tests here, we hate asking people to take them during an interview. More importantly, we hate asking people to “white-board” solutions.

We—as an industry—can do better. So, just how can we do better?

### Solution
We developed this coding challenge to help us better gauge your technical abilities. This challenge:

*  can be completed on your own time
*  where you are most comfortable
*  on equipment you’re accustomed to
*  using the tools you’re proficient with

Basically, you have access to all the things that allow you to work best.

We hope you’ll enjoy working through this challenge as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it for you.

### Guidelines
Because we’re awful developers, this project isn’t quite ready to release. There are some broken pieces that we’d like you to fix. To do that, you’ll need to:

1. Fork this project.
2. Fix any problems you find with it.
3. Open a PR with your changes.
4. You have 24-hours.
